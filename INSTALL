Prerequisites
-------------

You need the following to compile:

- a current boost version (tested with 1.35)
- GNU NANA  (Logging + Assertions)
- an SDP-Solver (see below)


Compiling
---------

$ mkdir -p build/release
$ cd build/release
$ cmake ../../src
$ make


SDP-Solvers
------------

You will need at least one of the following:
1) CSDP
   $ cd src/third_party/Csdp-6.0.1
   $ make
2) DSDP
   -> get debian package via apt-get
3) SDPA
   first, make sure you have ATLAS/BLAS installed
   $ cd src/third_party/sdpa-7.1.1/
   $ ./configure --with-blas="-latlas"

   more help is available here:

4) SDPLR
   again, you will need ATLAS/BLAS
   $ cd src/third_party/SDPLR-1.02
   $ make

Finally, run cmake, it will detect the installed libraries 
and compile the wrappers as needed.
